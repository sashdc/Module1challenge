#  Module 1 : Code Refactoring using HTML, CSS, and Git

## Overview

The client, "Horiseon", required the site's code to be refactored to be cleaner, more streamlined, and more accessible. This includes
- Adding semantic elements to the HTML
- Consolidating CSS selectors and properties
- Organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements
- Including comments before each element or section of the page
- Adding Alt atttributes to images and icons
- Making sure all links within the page work

These changes should help make the page more favourable for Search Engine Optimization, run smoother, and be more accessible to those with barriers.
